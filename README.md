## Overview
This version of Marlin contains my own personal changes to support my 3d Printer.  
It is based off the [bugfix-2.1.x branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-2.1.x), specifically [commit d5cf0b3348](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/d5cf0b334802cf825e501135a55d1d63884004a1).  Please see the original Marlin repo for information about the firmware itself.

3D Printing has been a very challenging hobby for me.  Plenty of people have had good luck with the stock Creality Ender3 Pro, but for me I was plagued with adhesion and other issues from the start.  As a result I have many upgrades, some necessary, some not.  My current setup is listed below to provide context on the specific firmware I am using and to let others know how my printer is now configured.  It is technically still an Ender3 Pro, but the only original parts are the frame, bed carriage, screen, and Z/Y motors.
